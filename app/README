# How to start program
Run mbl_data_converter.exe
You can right click and create a shortcut of the exe and drag it to the desktop for easier access

# XML Inputs/Outputs
* Select Input Xml - Select the xml file that is generated by the MotionRocket API translator
* Select Output Xml - Select the xml file that is shared/located on the tricaster machine. You must create this xml file.
 The program will not make it for you.

# Tricaster Keys
Keys can be added one per line and saved using the 'Save Keys' button. Keys must be in the format '%value value%'.
This should be how they appear/are used in the tricaster machine as well. Currently only keys starting with the same
value can be used. You can't mix '%CurrentPitcher fullName%' and '%CurrentBatter fullName%'

# Processing
Once you have the correct files and keys put in you can hit 'Start' on the bottom right to begin processing the values.
When the green bar on the bottom fills it indicates that the xml values will be processed. The status next to this
indicates if the program is currently running or stopped.

# Logging
Logs are found in the log folder. By default only warnings and higher will be shown but you can set debug=true in the
config.ini to show more logging messages. Logs are sorted by date and new logs will be appended to the current dates log.

NOTE: It's recommended to have debug=false when running the program in most cases so the log files don't get too large.

# Config
The config.ini file is created when you first run the program and contains some configuration data

[FILE PATHS]
inputxml - Default 'None' - This is path to the input xml file. It is not recommended to change this here but use the program to set it.
outputxml - Default 'None' - This is path to the output xml file. It is not recommended to change this here but use the program to set it.

[PARSE SETTINGS]
pollrate - Default '1' - This is the number of seconds to wait between parsing the xml.

[GENERAL]
debug - Default 'false' - This will enable more messages in the logs for debugging purposes. WARNING: Turning this on will result in more logged messages and larger log files.
